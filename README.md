# Python WebDAV Client Utilities

WebDAV is an HTTP extension used for cloud storage communication. This repository contains a set of Python scripts to demonstrate interactions with cloud storage providers via the [WebDAV Client Utilities](https://github.com/michemcc/webdav-client-utils) module.

## Usage

These examples require Python 3. To install prerequisites:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will need to authenticate with the WebDAV servers (i.e. Dropbox,
Box, etc) to use these scripts. To do so, create an account at the below websites:

[https://www.dropbox.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/)

[https://app.box.com/login/](https://app.box.com/login/)

Once you have created your storage account, you are ready to begin using the utilities.
